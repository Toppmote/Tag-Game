# Tag-Game


##### This project on Java implements a tag game with modifications for Adroid. The modifications consist in changing the game mode and changing the dimension of the original field. There are 2 game modes in total: 
1. Classic mode. The task is to move the knuckles so as to arrange them by numbers.
2. Magic square. The task is to move the dice so that the sum of the numbers along the vertical, horizontal and large diagonal is a certain number (For 3x3 - 12, for 4x4 - 30). In this case, the numerical value of the empty cell is 0. Available for dimensions 3x3 and 4x4.

##### The following dimensionality options are available: 2x3, 2x4, 2x5, 2x6, 2x7, 2x8, 3x3, 3x4, 3x5, 4x4. For each dimension, the level of complexity of the assembly can be selected. There are 3 levels of difficulty in total:
1. Easy. Assembly without limitation of the number of moves and no time limit.
2. Normal. Assembly with a limited number of moves.
3. Difficult. Assembly with a limited number of moves and a time limit.

##### Also in the menu you can see the records for each dimension and difficulty level for it.
